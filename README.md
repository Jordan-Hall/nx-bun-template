# This is a NX template that works with both BUN 1.0.2.

By default it uses [@nx-bun/nx](https://github.com/jordan-hall/nx-bun) plugin to create bun apps and libs

I've added a patch for the nx library to add bun package manager into NX

Currently have two PR solutions for Bun package manager in NX:
https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/15622
https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/19113

Any issues is likelly with patch or @nx-bun. Please raise a issue in  [@nx-bun/nx](https://github.com/jordan-hall/nx-bun) first as its the main repo and contains the patch work too.
